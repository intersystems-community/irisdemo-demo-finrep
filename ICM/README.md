# Running the HTAP Speed Test on AWS using ICM

We are using [InterSystems Cloud Manager (ICM)](https://docs.intersystems.com/irislatest/csp/docbook/Doc.View.cls?KEY=GICM_oview) to help us to provision the infrastructure for these Ingestion tests on AWS. 

ICM is built on top of Terraform and allows you to declare your infrastructure as code (a very simple JSON file) and to provision it. ICM also allows you to deploy InterSystems IRIS in this infrastructure in a variety of configurations:
* A simple InterSystems IRIS database server
* An InterSystems IRIS database server with a replica (mirror) on a second availability zone (data center)
* A full blown InterSystems IRIS database server with shards and compute nodes
* etc.

Finally, you can use ICM to deploy your own application as Docker images! This HTAP Speed Test is packaged like this. See the architecture of the Speed Test [here](https://github.com/intersystems-community/irisdemo-demo-htap/blob/master/README.md) for more information. ICM will deploy all of this automatically for you on AWS.

**This folder has scripts that are written to make using ICM with AWS very easy!** 

Here is how it will work:

![Deployment Diagram on AWS](/ICM/aws_speedtest_deployment.png?raw=true)

On step 1, you use the provided scripts to:
* Provision the infrastructure on AWS which will also create a VPC for us there.
* Deploy InterSystems IRIS on AWS on this VPC
* Deploy The Speed Test for InterSystems IRIS on AWS on this VPC
* Deploy The Speed Test for the other database you are comparing InterSystems IRIS with on AWS on this same VPC

Then, on step 2, you need to manually deploy the other database you are comparing InterSystems IRIS with on that same VPC ICM created for us. Don't worry! We will guide you all the way!

# Pre-Requisites

To run the HTAP Speed Test with InterSystems IRIS on AWS, you will need:
* Basic understanding of AWS EC2 
* An AWS account
* Git installed on your machine so you can clone this repository on your local PC
* Docker installed on your machine so you can run ICM
* An **InterSystems IRIS 2020 License for Ubuntu**. Careful: This must not be a docker based license. We are using ICM to deploy a containerless installation of InterSystems IRIS on AWS.
* InterSystems IRIS 2020 install kit for Ubuntu
* ICM 2020 docker image

If you are a supported InterSystems customer, you can download **InterSystems IRIS for Linux Ubuntu** and an InterSystems IRIS license from the [Evaluation Service](https://evaluation.intersystems.com).

You will also need to go to the [Worldwide Response Center (WRC)](https://wrc.intersystems.com) and download ICM for InterSystems IRIS 2020. If you need help, just send an e-mail to support@intersystems.com and we will be glad to help!

If you are not an InterSystems customer, you will still be able to run the HTAP Speed Test on your PC comparing InterSystems IRIS with some databases such as MySQL and SQL Server. Just follow instructions [here](https://github.com/intersystems-community/irisdemo-demo-htap/blob/master/README.md).


# Preparing the Environment

You must execute the following steps, independently of which database you want to test on AWS.

## 1. Clonning the repo

Clone this repository to your git folder on your PC:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/intersystems-community/irisdemo-demo-htap
```

## 2. Copy the InterSystems IRIS license key

Put the iris.key file on the folder **./irisdemo-demo-htap/ICM/ICMDurable/license/**. You will see that there is a file there called "replace_this_file_with_your_iris_key". Make sure to:
1. Delete the file "replace_this_file_with_your_iris_key"
2. There is only one license key file on the folder. If you let more than one key file there, you may have problems.
3. You are using the right iris.key for your scenario. We are deploying a containerless IRIS, so you should use an IRIS key for Ubuntu Linux.

## 3. Preparing ICM to be run and InterSystems IRIS to be deployed

You downloaded InterSystems IRIS and ICM from the [Evaluation Service](https://evaluation.intersystems.com) and [Worldwide Response Center (WRC)](https://wrc.intersystems.com) as per instructions above and now you must have two tar.gz files like these:

```bash
IRIS-2020.2.0.196.0-lnxubuntux64.tar.gz
icm-2020.2.0.196.0-docker.tar.gz
```

**Please, notice that the InterSystems IRIS tar.gz is NOT a docker image. It is a normal InterSystems IRIS install kit for Ubuntu.**

Copy the InterSystems IRIS install kit to the folder **ICM/ICMDurable/IRISKit/**.

ICM must be loaded into your local docker installation with the following commands:
```bash
docker load --input ./icm-2020.2.0.196.0-docker.tar.gz

...

Loaded image: intersystems/icm:2020.2.0.196.0
```

This last message is very important. It gives you the full name of the ICM image you just loaded: **intersystems/icm:2020.2.0.196.0**. This name has two parts: 
- ICM Repository: intersystems/icm
- ICM Tag: 2020.2.0.196.0

Make sure that the file **ICM/ICMDurable/CONF_ICM_TAG** contains the same tag above (i.e: 2020.2.0.204.0) so that when you try to run the **icm.sh** script (or the **icm.ps1** script on Powershell), it will use the right ICM version.

We are going to deploy a container-less IRIS on AWS, so no additional configuration is needed beyond your AWS credentials (next topic). 

## 4. Configuring AWS Credentials

You must add your AWS Credential to file ICM/ICMDurable/aws.credentials. It looks like this:

```
[default]
aws_access_key_id = ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
aws_secret_access_key = dsfsDFSDFSDSD4534534FDG4FDGD
aws_session_token = A_VERY_LARGE_STRING_ENDED_WITH==
```

## 5. Deploying and Running the Speed Test

All right! You are ready to go! :)
